# Microbial Competition & Phosphorus Limitation at EucFACE

## Project Overview
This project replicates and extends the findings of *Jiang et al. (Nature, 2024)*, investigating why mature forests fail to sequester additional carbon under elevated CO2 (eCO2) in phosphorus-limited soils.

The study analyzes 6 years of data (2013-2018) from the EucFACE experiment to test the "Microbial Pre-emption Hypothesis": that soil microbes outcompete trees for scarce phosphorus, locking it away and preventing tree growth responses to eCO2.

## Structure
* data/: Contains raw CSV files for soil P, microbial P, wood carbon, and GPP.
* scripts/: R scripts for data processing and analysis.
  - 01_data_cleaning.R: Prepares the master dataset.
  - 02_replication.R: Reproduces key findings from the Nature paper (Pool sizes & Stagnation).
  - 03_alternative.R: Tests a novel hypothesis on Phosphorus Use Efficiency (PUE).
* output/: Generated figures and statistical tables.

## Key Findings
1.  Replication: Confirmed that the microbial phosphorus pool is significantly larger than the available soil pool, supporting the pre-emption mechanism.
2.  Stagnation: Validated that tree biomass (Wood C) did not significantly increase under eCO2 over the study period (p > 0.05).
3.  Alternative Insight: Discovered functional plasticity; trees under eCO2 exhibit higher Phosphorus Use Efficiency (PUE), assimilating more carbon per unit of available soil phosphorus.

## Usage
Run the scripts in order: 01 -> 02 -> 03.
Requires R packages: tidyverse, lme4, lmerTest, patchwork.
