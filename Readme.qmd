# Microbial Competition & Tree Functional Plasticity at EucFACE

## Project Overview
This project investigates the constraints on forest carbon sequestration under elevated CO2 ($eCO_2$) in phosphorus-limited soils. It is based on data from the **EucFACE (Eucalyptus Free-Air CO2 Enrichment)** experiment (2013–2018).

The analysis acts as both a **replication** and an **extension** of the findings published by:
> *Jiang et al. (2024). Microbial competition for phosphorus limits the CO2 response of a mature forest. Nature.*

### The Core Problem
Elevated atmospheric $CO_2$ is expected to increase tree growth. However, in low-phosphorus soils, this growth often stagnates. The **"Microbial Pre-emption Hypothesis"** suggests that soil microbes outcompete trees for scarce phosphorus, locking it away and blocking the fertilization effect.

## Research Objectives

This project is divided into two distinct analytical phases:

### 1. Replication Phase (The "Lockout")
We verify the central claims of *Jiang et al.* using the EucFACE dataset:
   **Hypothesis 1:** The microbial phosphorus pool is significantly larger than the available soil phosphorus pool.
   **Hypothesis 2:** Tree biomass (wood carbon) shows no significant increase under $eCO_2$ over time (Biomass Stagnation).

### 2. Alternative Phase (The Adaptation)
We extend the analysis to test if trees exhibit **Functional Plasticity** (physiological adaptation) despite the biomass stagnation.
   **Hypothesis 3:** Trees under $eCO_2$ increase their **Phosphorus Use Efficiency (PUE)** (assimilating more Carbon per unit of Phosphorus lost).
   **Hypothesis 4:** Trees shift carbon allocation from wood to **fine roots** to forage more aggressively for nutrients.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into a modular pipeline for reproducibility.
